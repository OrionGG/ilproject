<p>These classes are part of the MusicBrainz domain model. They may be used by other modules 
and don't contain any network or other I/O code. If you want to request data from the web 
service, please have a look at {@link org.musicbrainz.webservice}.
The most important classes, usually acting as entry points, are 
{@link org.musicbrainz.model.Artist}, {@link org.musicbrainz.model.Release}, and 
{@link org.musicbrainz.model.Track}.
